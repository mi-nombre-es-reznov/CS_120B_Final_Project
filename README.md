# CS_120B_Final_Project
This will be my CS_120B final project - The Beat Trainer

<h1>Description of Project</h1>

<p>This repository is going to be tracking my changes and additions throughout these next couple of weeks.
The goal this far, is to get familiar with how to use Github and teach myself how to make a project work on here, for possible future projects.</p>

<h2>Here is the official start of my project! This is what a beginning of something looks like. This is a moment in history, not really, in which we get
to see the start of a project versus the completed product that is typically mass produced, sold, and sitting in our households.</p>
